    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Turn your weeknight dinner into a fancy affair with this easy pork
      tenderloin recipe.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound pork tenderloin</li>
      <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 bunch fresh sage, leaves removed and stems discarded, divided</li>
      <li>6 ounces prosciutto</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Lightly season pork with salt and black pepper. Arrange about 6 sage
        leaves over tenderloin. Wrap prosciutto around tenderloin and sage,
        overlapping prosciutto slightly; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate to
        allow prosciutto to set on pork tenderloin, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove
        plastic wrap.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry wrapped tenderloin in
        the hot oil until prosciutto is crispy and lightly browned on all sides,
        8 to 10 minutes. Transfer wrapped tenderloin to a baking dish, reserving
        oil in the skillet.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake tenderloin in the preheated oven until pork is cooked through,
        about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
        should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat reserved oil in the skillet over medium heat; fry remaining sage
        leaves until crispy, adding more oil as needed, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Slice tenderloin and serve with crispy sage leaves.</li>
    </ol>
